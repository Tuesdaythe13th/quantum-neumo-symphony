## üéπ Using the Application

The Quantum Synesthetic Mapper is primarily controlled through its main Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)-like interface, accessible at the root path (`/`) of the application.

### Main DAW Interface (Homepage `/`)

The interface is designed to provide a comprehensive environment for both manipulating quantum parameters and experiencing their audio-visual output. It's organized into several key areas:

#### Layout Overview
The main interface features a multi-column layout on desktop screens (typically a 4-column grid), which responsively stacks for usability on mobile devices.
*   **Top Bar:** Contains the main transport controls.
*   **Left Column (Desktop):** Houses core synthesis parameters and the Quantum Matrix Pad.
*   **Center Area (Desktop - Spans 2 Columns):** Dominated by the large Quantum Visualizer, with the Audio Output section directly below it.
*   **Right Column (Desktop - Accordion):** Provides access to detailed QPIXL settings, Audio Effects, Advanced Synthesis options, and Analysis panels. This entire column is collapsible to save space.

#### 1. üéß DAW Transport

    *   **Play/Stop Button:** The primary control to start and stop the quantum audio synthesis and visualization. Pressing **Play** will:
        *   Initialize the audio engine (if not already active on first interaction).
        *   Generate new audio and QPIXL data based on the current settings (especially if starting from a stopped state or if settings have changed).
        *   Begin playback and real-time visualization.
    *   **BPM Display:** Shows the current tempo (currently non-interactive, for future use).
    *   **Time Display:** Shows the current playback time.
    *   **Save/Export/Settings Buttons:** Placeholder buttons for future functionality (e.g., saving presets, exporting audio).
    *   **Upload/Download Buttons:** Placeholder buttons for future file operations.
    *   **Walkthrough Guide (‚ùî HelpCircle Icon):** Click this to open an interactive step-by-step guide to the interface.

#### 2. üñºÔ∏è Quantum Visualizer Area

### üêç Python Bridge Page (`/python-bridge`)

*   **Purpose:** This page serves two main functions:
    1.  Connecting to a live Python backend (quantum simulators, QPUs, or other data sources) that streams quantum data via WebSockets.
    2.  Testing and demoing the `QuantumSynestheticViz` component with sample QPIXL data without needing an active Python backend.
*   **Accessing:** Navigate to `/python-bridge` in your browser.

#### Key Features & Usage:
*   **WebSocket Port:** Input field to specify the port your Python WebSocket server is running on (default: 8765). The visualizer will attempt to connect if a valid port is entered.
*   **"Test QPIXL Mode" Button:**
    *   Click this to inject a predefined sample dataset directly into the `QuantumSynestheticViz` component.
    *   This sample data includes both `probabilities` (to trigger the QPIXL visualization mode) and a `qpixlData` (Float32Array for the grid visuals).
    *   Useful for instantly seeing the QPIXL visualizer in action and for demos.
*   **"Reset Test" Button:** Appears when Test Mode is active. Click to clear the injected test data and revert the visualizer to listening for WebSocket data (if a port is configured).
*   **"Show Debug" / "Hide Debug" Button:** Toggles a panel that displays the last received WebSocket message or the currently injected test data, allowing you to inspect the data structure.
*   **"Show Code" / "Hide Code" Button:** Toggles a panel displaying an example Python script (`qpixl_synesthetic_bridge.py`) that demonstrates how to send correctly formatted data to the visualizer.
*   **Instructions & Data Format Panel:** The bottom panel provides:
    *   Example Python commands to start a demo server.
    *   The expected JSON data structure for `quantum_state_update` messages, including `probabilities` and `qpixlData`.
    *   Basic troubleshooting tips for this page.

## üß© Key Architectural Components

Understanding the core components can be helpful for developers or those curious about the inner workings:

*   **`src/components/VisualAnalyzer.tsx`**: This is the heart of the visual output. It's a versatile React component that uses the HTML5 Canvas API to render all different visualization modes (Waveform, Frequency, Quantum Simulation, and the detailed QPIXL Grid). It receives data and configuration as props and handles the direct drawing logic.
*   **`src/components/QuantumSynestheticViz.tsx`**: This component acts as a specialized wrapper, primarily for the `/python-bridge` page. It encapsulates `VisualAnalyzer` and adds functionality for WebSocket connections to receive external quantum data (like QPIXL streams from a Python backend). It also manages its own state for external data injection and testing.
*   **`src/lib/quantumAudioEngine.ts`**: The powerhouse for sound generation. This class is responsible for all audio synthesis, including interpreting quantum settings, generating various waveforms, applying effects, and crucially, creating the QPIXL `Float32Array` data that can be used by both the audio engine (to modulate sound) and the `VisualAnalyzer` (for QPIXL grid display).
*   **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**: The main application page that constructs the DAW-like user interface. It integrates and manages the state for most of the control components, the `VisualAnalyzer`, and the `quantumAudioEngine`.
*   **`src/pages/PythonBridge.tsx`**: Interface for testing with external Python data or internal test QPIXL data. It uses `QuantumSynestheticViz` to display the results.
*   **`src/components/Walkthrough.tsx`**: The interactive, step-by-step user guide component. It's designed to be easily integrated and provides contextual help and highlighting for different UI elements on the `Index.tsx` page.

## üí° Basic Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are a few common scenarios and tips:

*   **Visualizer is Blank or Not Showing Expected QPIXL Data:**
    *   **On the Main DAW Page (`/`):**
        *   Ensure "QPIXL Integration" is switched ON in the QPIXL Settings panel.
        *   Press the main **Play** button in the DAW Transport to generate audio and QPIXL data.
        *   Check the "QPIXL Status Indicator" below the visualizer type selectors for messages like "No Data" or "Integration Disabled."
    *   **On the Python Bridge Page (`/python-bridge`):**
        *   Use "Test QPIXL Mode" first. Click the button and see if the visualizer updates. Check the Debug Panel to confirm test data (including `probabilities` and `qpixlData`) was injected.
        *   If using WebSockets:
            *   Verify your Python server is running and sending data to the correct WebSocket port (default: 8765).
            *   Ensure the port number in the UI matches your Python server's port.
            *   Check the Debug Panel on the `/python-bridge` page for incoming messages and their structure. The data must include a `probabilities` object to activate QPIXL mode in `QuantumSynestheticViz` and ideally a `qpixlData` (Float32Array) for the grid.
*   **No Audio Output:**
    *   Check the Master Volume slider (in the Advanced Synthesis accordion on the main page, then within its "Master Volume" item).
    *   Ensure you have interacted with the page (e.g., clicked a button) to allow the browser to initialize the AudioContext. This is a common browser security feature.
    *   Look for any error messages in your browser's developer console (usually F12).
*   **Walkthrough Highlighting Seems Off or Not Working:**
    *   The CSS class selectors defined in `Walkthrough.tsx` for highlighting specific elements must exactly match the class names applied to those elements in `Index.tsx`. If the layout or class names in `Index.tsx` change, the `highlight` selectors in `Walkthrough.tsx` might need updating.
*   **General UI Issues or Unexpected Behavior:**
    *   Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear any cached assets.
    *   Open your browser's developer console to check for any error messages.
